##Question A
```
s2 = 0
s3 = s0

while s3 != 0:
    s2 += s1
    s3 -= 1
```
##Question B
```
As the loop is only re-executed while s3 is not equal to  zero, and each time the loop is run s1 is added to s2, and as s2 is set to zero at the start of the program, this means that s1 times s0 will be the value of 2, I.E. if the loop runs once, s1, which has the value of 1 will be added to s2 making it have the value of 1, thus having the effect of multiplying S1 and S2.
